Goal:
I have a DOCX file that contains a table with 4 columns structured as:

1. Questions


2. Sample (for reference only)


3. Answers


4. Comments v3



Inside the table, multiple rows exist.
I need to extract values from a JSON file (aots_information_tab.json) and put them in the correct Answers column based on the Questions column.


---

What the script must do:

1. Open the DOCX file and locate the table.


2. For each row:

Read the value in Column 1 (Questions).

If Column 1 contains the specific keyword “AOTS” (example: Application Name (AOTS ID), AOTS CR, etc.)



3. For that row, go to Column 3 (Answers) and fill it with the correct JSON data fields.


4. JSON file structure example is like:



{
  "Information": {
      "CR": "CHG000010532615",
      "Summary": "",
      ...
  },
  "Assessment": {
      "Planned Start Date": "...",
      "Planned End Date": "...",
      ...
  }
}

5. For each AOTS-related question:

If Question mentions CR, fill the Answer cell with JSON["Information"]["CR"]

If Question mentions Planned Start Date (CT), fill the Answer with JSON["Assessment"]["Planned Start Date"]

If Question mentions Planned End Date (CT), fill the Answer with JSON["Assessment"]["Planned End Date"]

Continue this mapping for all other rows.



6. Rewrite the modified DOCX and save it.

Output code requirements:

Use python-docx to read/write DOCX tables.

Load the JSON using built-in json module.

Create a function fill_doc_from_json(doc_path, json_path, output_path).

Code must:

iterate rows safely,

trim whitespace,

handle missing fields gracefully.
